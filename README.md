This is a lerna monorepo containing 2 packages; a frontend app and a backend app. We intend to expand it sometime in the future with other packages.

**Everything here is built from scratch while leveraging basic libraries like Express, ReactJs etc.**

To reach out to the developer: daveanifowoshe@gmail.com

See the documentation of each package to understand its underlining architecture, concepts and design ideologies.
